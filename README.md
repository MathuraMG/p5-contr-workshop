Learn about the p5.js project, its relationship to Processing and the Processing Foundation, and how you can contribute. Contributing to p5 and open source in general is a great way to get better at GitHub and write code with other people!

We’ll spend the first half giving a big picture overview of the p5.js library, the web editor, and p5 accessibility. Then, we’ll walk through contributing an example for the website.

We’ll assume you’re somewhat familiar with GitHub.
